      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>  I'm originally from Fredericksburg, VA, but have been calling Blacksburg home for these past four amazing years of Hokie football. My first internship was fresh out of my first year of college and it gave me the wonderful opportunity to move to New York, New York by myself when I was 18; I loved every second (and every wrong turn) of it! I worked in Chelsea, Manhattan at a fully-digitalized startup maganine where I was both a content creator and marketing strategest fousing on search engine optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I have been involved in Greek life on campus, have help multiple leadership positions, and worked as the only intern at the Hanover Company, one of the most active private real estate companies in the United States specializing in acquisition, development, and management of high quality, multi-family residential properties nationwide. I am the only person to ever be hired for an internship in the the over three decades that The Hanover Company has been in operation. Moving to the site location in Baltimore, MD and working with my team and residents was an incredible and informative experience and it is those relationships, as well as the bottom line of the business, that I cherished growing and will continue to strive to grow in my future professional endeavors.
